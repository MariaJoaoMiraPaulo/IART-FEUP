## Intruction

In this project, we are going to implement a neural network for recognizing Grammatical Facial Expressions (GFEs) used in the Brazilian Sign Language.
To do so we'll use ConvNetJS, a Javascript library, to train a neural network using backpropagation algorithms.

## Project Structure

### [Convnetjs Demos](https://github.com/pedro-c/IART-FEUP/tree/master/Convnetjs%20Demos)
Contains a few examples of using Convuntional Neural Networks. ConvNetJS implements Deep Learning models and learning algorithms as well as nice browser-based demos, all in Javascript.

### [GFE Data](https://github.com/pedro-c/IART-FEUP/tree/master/GFE%20Data)

#### Pre-processed

Pre-processed data in json format.

#### Raw
Grammatical Facial Expressions for Brazilian Sign Language

The dataset is organized in 36 files: 18 datapoint files and 18 target files, one pair for each video which compose the dataset.The name of the file refers to each video: the letter corresponding to the user (A and B), name of grammatical facial expression and a specification (target or datapoints).

Contains:
  - Datapoints files (* _ datapoints.txt): a timestamp (double) and 100 numeric attributes (double)

  - Targets files (* _ targets.txt): a class attribute (interger)

### [Parser](https://github.com/pedro-c/IART-FEUP/tree/master/Parser)
  Small CLI python program to parse datapoints in a `.txt` files to usefull data in `.json` format

### [Reports](https://github.com/pedro-c/IART-FEUP/tree/master/Repors)
  Project reports.

### [webapp](https://github.com/pedro-c/IART-FEUP/tree/master/webapp)
  Our implementation of a neural network using ConvNetJS to rate facial expressions.
